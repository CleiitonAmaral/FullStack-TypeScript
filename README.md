## Installation 🛠️

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CleiitonAmaral/FullStack-TypeScript.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd FullStack-TypeScript
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm install
     ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in both the backend and frontend directories. Use the provided `.env.example` as a guide.

5. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```
   - Start the frontend server:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm start
     ```

Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://localhost:5000` for the backend.

## Usage 📖

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through the frontend interface. Here are some features you can explore:

- **User Registration**: Sign up to create an account.
- **User Login**: Log in to access protected routes.
- **Data Fetching**: Use React Query to fetch data from the backend seamlessly.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on your data.
